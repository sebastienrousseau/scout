# Governance

scout is a small, focused open-source project. This document describes how
decisions are made, who makes them, and what happens if key people become
unavailable.

## Roles

### Maintainer

The **Maintainer** is the person with commit access to
`sebastienrousseau/scout` who is responsible for the direction, quality,
release cadence, and security of the project.

**Current maintainer:** Sebastien Rousseau
(<sebastian.rousseau@gmail.com>, GitHub: `@sebastienrousseau`).

Responsibilities:

- Review and merge pull requests.
- Triage issues within a best-effort window of 7 days.
- Cut releases and sign every release tag.
- Respond to security disclosures per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- Keep dependencies patched and CI green.

### Contributor

Anyone who opens an issue, comments on a discussion, or submits a pull
request is a **Contributor**. Contributors do not need commit access; the
Maintainer merges accepted contributions after review.

Contribution mechanics are documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Decision-making

Because scout has a single Maintainer, decisions are ultimately made by the
Maintainer after considering community input. The Maintainer commits to:

- Explaining the reasoning behind non-trivial rejections in the relevant
  issue or PR thread.
- Documenting significant architectural or scope decisions in the CHANGELOG
  and, where the decision will be questioned later, as a record in
  [docs/adr/](docs/adr/README.md).
- Deferring stylistic tie-breakers to the existing code base's conventions.

For substantial changes that affect users (new subcommands, breaking flag
changes, a change to what a finding means or to how the score is derived,
or removing features), the Maintainer will open a tracking issue and
welcome comments for at least one week before landing the change.

## Access continuity and succession

The single-Maintainer model creates a real bus-factor risk. The full
succession procedure — voluntary hand-off, community fork after
≥ 6 months of unresponsiveness, and emergency compromise response —
is documented in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md). Key facts, in short:

- **Repository ownership**: The `sebastienrousseau/scout` repository lives
  under the `sebastienrousseau` GitHub organisation, administered by the
  Maintainer. Any user may fork under GPL-3.0 without further permission.
- **Release signing**: Release tags are signed with the Maintainer's SSH
  key, and every release artefact is additionally keyless-signed with
  cosign and carries a SLSA provenance attestation — those two remain
  publicly verifiable against Rekor even if the SSH key is later rotated.
  The current fingerprint is recorded in
  [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) §"External services and accounts".
- **External services**: A full catalogue (GitHub organisation, Actions,
  ghcr.io, Homebrew tap, AUR, Sigstore) lives in
  [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md), each row noting the configuration file
  a successor must edit.
- **Community fork**: If the Maintainer is unresponsive for ≥ 6 months
  (no issue comments, no releases, no PR merges), the community is
  encouraged to fork per the procedure in
  [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) §"Community fork (unplanned)".
- **Security model**: The public assurance case in
  [docs/security-model.md](docs/security-model.md) records the claims,
  evidence, and out-of-scope threats a successor inherits, so
  handover is not tribal.

## Adding a co-Maintainer

If a regular contributor demonstrates sustained high-quality contributions
over ≥ 6 months and expresses interest in ongoing maintenance, the
Maintainer will consider granting them commit access and updating this
document. Criteria the current Maintainer will look for:

- Merged pull requests spanning more than one package — a phase in
  `internal/probe`, the recorder, and the CLI review very differently.
- Constructive issue triage and code review comments.
- Willingness to be reachable for security disclosures.

## Changes to this document

Changes to `GOVERNANCE.md` are made through the usual pull request process
and require the Maintainer's approval. Because the Maintainer is currently
the only person with commit access, the community input mechanism for
substantial governance changes is the same as for substantial code changes:
open an issue for discussion at least one week before the change lands.
