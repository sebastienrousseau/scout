A badge is a score that travels. The number in a CI log is read once, by
whoever ran it; the same number in a README is read by everybody deciding
whether to point an agent at the server.

  scout check URL --output json > report.json
  scout badge report.json > badge.json

Commit badge.json somewhere it is served over HTTPS, then point shields at
it:

  ![scout](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://example.com/badge.json)

With no argument, or with -, the report is read from standard input.

The colour follows the report's own grade, so the badge cannot disagree
with the document it came from. A run that never reached a verdict renders
as an error rather than as a low score: a pipeline that went green because
the endpoint was down is the failure this exists to avoid, and a badge
reading 0/100 would repeat it.`,
