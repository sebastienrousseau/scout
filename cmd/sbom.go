Given a Go program, the module graph embedded in it is read. The program is
resolved through PATH, the way a shell would resolve it, and is opened and
read, never executed. Every dependency the toolchain linked in is emitted
with its package URL and its h1: module checksum. The toolchain, the target
platform, the commit and whether the tree was dirty when it was built travel
as metadata properties, because CycloneDX has no field for them and a bill
of materials that dropped them would say less than the binary does.

Given a directory, its lockfiles are read: package-lock.json, uv.lock,
Cargo.lock and requirements.txt, every one present. Only the directory
itself is read, never node_modules. Each package carries the hash its
package manager recorded. A lockfile is what the project declares was
installed rather than what is running, and the document says so in a
scout:evidence property.

Either way, an entry nothing can verify (no checksum, a git or local-path
source, a requirement with no pin or no --hash) is marked
scout:unverifiable with the reason, rather than left silently short of a
hash.

A program that is not a Go binary is an error, not an empty document: for
a TypeScript, Python or Rust server, name its project directory instead.
A server run straight from npx or uvx has no local lockfile to read.

The document is reproducible: the serial number is derived from what is
being described rather than generated at random, and SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, if
set, fixes the timestamp. The same input described twice gives the same
bytes.`,
