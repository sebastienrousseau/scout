	Use:   "watch <endpoint>",
	Short: "Report when a server stops being the one you approved.",
	Long: `Watch a server's catalogue and report what changed.

A check tells you a server was sound when you ran it. That is a statement
about a moment, and the threat it cannot see by construction is the one
that waits: the server that passes review and edits its tool descriptions
the following week is the server that gets through.

  scout check URL --baseline .scout/baseline.json --approve
  scout watch URL --baseline .scout/baseline.json

A pulse is deliberately small -- connect, list the catalogue, hash it,
compare -- because a watcher that re-ran nine phases on a loop would be the
abusive client scout warns everyone else about. Two requests and a string
comparison, every few minutes, and a timer in between.

  --once takes a single pulse and exits, which is the shape a CI job
  wants: exit 2 when the catalogue is not the approved one, 0 when it is,
  and 1 when scout never got an answer at all.

Severity is by kind rather than by count. A readOnlyHint becoming true
after approval is critical, because it is the flip that makes a cautious
client start invoking a tool it previously refused. A new optional
property is noise, and is reported as such.`,
