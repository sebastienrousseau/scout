// same split SLSA provenance uses, and the reason the predicate is derived
// from the report rather than from the session.
//
// `verify` is deliberately not a verdict about the server. It answers
// whether the statement can be believed: that it parses, that its digest
// still covers the target it names, that it says what it was judged against.
// Whether the server is good enough is a separate question, answered by the
// gate flags for a one-off and by --policy for anything an organisation has
// to agree on.

The statement is the same one 'scout check --output attestation' produces.
It exists as a separate command because the job that signs an attestation
is usually not the job that ran the diagnostic: run scout where the server
credentials live, save the report, then attest and sign somewhere that has
an OIDC identity and no access to the server at all.

  scout check URL --output json > report.json
  scout attest report.json > attestation.json

With no argument, or with -, the report is read from standard input.

Signing is left to the tool your pipeline already trusts, because an
attestation nobody can verify offline is not worth producing:

  cosign attest-blob --predicate attestation.json --new-bundle-format ...

By default this answers one question: can the statement be believed? It
parses, its subject digest still covers the target it names, its subject is
named for that same target, and it records what the verdicts were judged
against. That is verification, and it is not the same as approval. A
statement can be perfectly valid and describe a server you would never
route to.

Approval is the flags, and each one is a gate that exits 2 when it is not
met:

  --require ID      the named check must have passed
  --max-fail N      at most N checks may have failed
  --min-score N     the score must be at least N
  --endpoint URL    the statement must be about this target
  --against FILE    no check may be worse than in this earlier statement

A gate applies because the flag was given, not because of its value:
--max-fail 0 is the strictest form of that gate, and omitting the flag is
how you ask for no gate at all.

  scout verify attestation.json --endpoint https://mcp.example.com/mcp \
    --require auth.unauthenticated_tools --max-fail 0

--against compares two statements about the same target, check by check.
Drift is a delta rather than a threshold: a score that did not move can
hide one check that went from pass to fail beside another that went the
other way. Checks that got worse fail the gate; improvements, checks the
later run did not assess, and checks it newly measured are listed. The
score delta is shown only when both were judged under the same rubric.

  scout verify today.json --against approved.json

--reproduce repeats the run the statement records and gates on what got
worse since. A live service cannot give the same answer twice, but the
measurement can be made the same way twice, and the difference is drift:

  scout verify approved.json --reproduce --endpoint https://mcp.example.com/mcp \
    --token-env MCP_TOKEN

It is the one form of verify that contacts anything, so it runs only
against a target named with --endpoint that the statement covers, and it
takes from the statement only how the server was measured. Credentials
come from this command line, never from the statement, which records no
secret and whose recorded variable names are not read. Permissions such
as --allow-mutations must be given again and must match the recorded run.

For anything an organisation has to agree on, use a file instead:

  scout verify attestation.json --policy company.json

A policy is reviewable, it carries exceptions with a reason and an expiry
date, and it is refused rather than partly applied if it was written for a
later scout. The same file governs a live run through "scout check
--policy", so what gates a pipeline and what a gateway checks months later
cannot drift apart.

Exit status is 0 when every gate is met, 2 when the statement is valid and
a gate is not, and 1 when the statement cannot be believed at all. A
gateway or registry should treat 1 and 2 differently: the first means the
evidence is unusable, the second means the evidence is good and the answer
is no.

Nothing here checks a signature. Verify the envelope with the tool that
produced it (cosign, or your own trust root), then verify what is inside it
