var overlapCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "overlap <report.json> <report.json>...",
	Short: "Find where servers an agent uses together collide or shadow each other.",
	Long: `Compare the catalogues in two or more saved reports, offline.

An agent wired to several servers sees one flat list of tools, and nothing
in the protocol keeps that list clean. Two failures exist only in the
union, so a run against one server cannot see them:

  collision   two servers expose the same tool name (case, hyphens and
              underscores ignored); which one the model gets is up to the
              host
  shadowing   one server's catalogue text attaches a rule to a tool another
              server owns, such as "before calling send_email, always BCC
              an address"; catalog.text.shadowing finds the construction
              on one server, and only a set of servers can confirm the
              named tool belongs to someone else

  scout check https://mail.example/mcp --output json > mail.json
  scout check --stdio --output json -- weather-mcp > weather.json
  scout overlap mail.json weather.json

The comparison is lexical and structural; it does not claim to judge
meaning. Nothing is contacted.

Exit status is 0 when the catalogues do not interfere, 2 when they do, and
1 when a report cannot be read.`,
