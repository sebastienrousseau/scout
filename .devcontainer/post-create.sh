# An unpinned installer means whatever the tag resolves to at container-build
# time then executes with the developer's credentials, and OpenSSF Scorecard
# flags it under Pinned-Dependencies. This repository pins its actions by SHA
# and its base image by digest; a devcontainer that shells out to @latest
# would be the one unpinned link in that chain.
#
# govulncheck matches the version ci.yml pins, so a local run and a CI run
# read the same database with the same scanner.

# The prose tools (markdownlint, codespell, pre-commit) are deliberately

#
# pip and npm cannot be pinned by hash without a hash-locked requirements
# file and a lockfile, and Scorecard's Pinned-Dependencies check is right
# to flag the unpinned form: it resolves at container-build time and then
# executes with the developer's credentials. Carrying that machinery for
# three convenience tools is not a trade worth making.
#
# Nothing is lost. The Docs Lint workflow is authoritative for all three,
# and DEVELOPMENT.md lists them as optional with install instructions.

cat <<'BANNER'

Ready. Useful targets:

  make            format, vet, lint, tests, build
  make test-race  race detector with shuffled order
  make fuzz       every fuzz target, short budget
  make docs       generate manpages + completions
  make help       every target

See DEVELOPMENT.md for the local equivalent of every CI gate.
