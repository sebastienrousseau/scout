# 0011 — The attestation format is Apache-2.0; the engine stays GPL

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-09-22

## Context

scout's position depends on other software consuming what it produces:
gateways gating on an attestation, registries displaying it, CI systems
verifying it. The engine is GPL-3.0-only, and none of those will embed GPL
code or implement a format whose only definition is GPL source. The plan's
answer was a separate `scout-reporting` repository under Apache-2.0, and
that repository was blocked on this decision.

## Decision

**The attestation predicate's schema and the scoring rubric are licensed
Apache-2.0.** They live in `spec/`, are generated from the Go that
implements them by `scripts/specgen`, and CI fails when either drifts from
the source:

- `spec/attestation/mcp-evaluation-v1.schema.json` — the in-toto Statement
  and the `mcp-evaluation/v1` predicate, as JSON Schema 2020-12, derived
  from the `internal/attest` types. A test validates a statement scout
  actually writes against it, and checks that tampered statements fail.
- `spec/rubric/rubric-v1.json` — weights, deductions, grade bands and the
  scoring rules, read from the same variables `ComputeScore` uses.
- `spec/README.md` — the format described for an implementer.

The format is Apache-2.0, not CC-BY, because it is consumed as code — a
schema compiled into a validator — and Apache-2.0 carries the patent grant
that implementers and their legal teams look for.

**The engine stays GPL-3.0-only**, including the Go that produces and
verifies statements, for now. The copyright in every relicensed file is
held by the one maintainer, so no contributor consent was needed; that
stops being true with the first outside contribution to `internal/attest`,
which is a reason to extract soon rather than late.

## What this unblocks, and what it does not

It unblocks **implementing** the format elsewhere: a gateway can write its
own verifier against the schema and the rubric today.

It does not yet unblock **embedding scout's verifier**. `internal/attest`
builds statements from `internal/probe` and `internal/report`, which are
GPL, so the verifier cannot be lifted out as it stands. The next step is to
split the statement types and `Validate` into a package that imports only
the standard library, then license that package Apache-2.0 and move it with
the schema into `scout-reporting`. That is a structure change and is done
on its own, not coupled to this decision.

Signing (W5) and the gateway pull requests (W8) are no longer blocked on a
licence question, only on that extraction.

## What would make this wrong

A format adopted under a different licence by the specification's own
process — for example if the MCP project standardises an evaluation
predicate. Then the right move is to align with it, and this record is
superseded.
