# Development

The single entry point for working on scout: toolchain, how to reproduce
every CI gate locally, how the tests are laid out, and how a release is cut.

If a gate fails in CI and you cannot reproduce it from this file, that is a
bug in this file — please report it.

## Toolchain

| Tool | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Go | as pinned by the `go` directive in `go.mod` | `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` downloads it; CI never pins a version separately, so `go.mod` is the single source of truth |
| make | any | Task runner for everything below |

Optional, only needed for the gate that uses them:

| Tool | Used by |
|---|---|
| `golangci-lint` | `make lint` |
| `goreleaser` | release dry runs |
| `groff` | manpage rendering check |
| `markdownlint-cli2`, `codespell`, `lychee` | the Docs Lint workflow and `pre-commit` |
| `nix` | optional; `nix develop` provides every row above, pinned |

Nothing else is required. There is no code generation step in the build,
no vendored dependency tree, and no CGO — `CGO_ENABLED=0` everywhere, which
is what makes the released binaries static and the cross-compilation
trivial.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/scout.git
cd scout
make            # format, vet, lint, tests, build
```

## Everyday tasks

`make help` lists every target. The ones you will actually use:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make build` | Compile `scout` into `build/` with version metadata |
| `make test` | Run the suite |
| `make test-race` | Race detector with randomised test order |
| `make fuzz` | Run every fuzz target for a short, fixed budget |
| `make docs` | Generate manpages and completions into `build/` |
| `make install` | Install under `PREFIX` (default `/usr/local`) |
| `make uninstall` | Remove everything `install` placed |
| `make clean` | Remove build output |

## Reproducing every CI gate

Every gate below is a job in `.github/workflows/`. The left column is what
CI runs; the right column is the identical command locally. If you run all
of them and they pass, CI will pass — the only thing you cannot reproduce
is the cross-platform matrix.

| CI job | Reproduce locally |
|---|---|
| Build and test | `go build ./... && make test` |
| Race and shuffled tests | `make test-race` |
| Lint | `make lint` |
| Vulnerability scan | `go run golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest ./...` |
| Licence headers (SPDX) | `make spdx-check` |
| SBOM drift | `make sbom` |
| Example compilation | `make example-check` |
| API compatibility | `make api-check` |
| Fuzz targets | `make fuzz` |
| Install contract | `make install-smoke` |
| Manpage rendering | `make docs && groff -man -Tutf8 -ww build/man/scout.1 >/dev/null` |
| Docs lint (markdown, spelling, links) | `pre-commit run --all-files` |

Coverage is not a separate job — the suite reports it. The threshold is
85% of statements per package, and the rationale is in
[Conventions](#conventions) below.

To check a release without publishing anything:

```sh
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean --skip=publish,sign,announce
```

That builds every target, runs the manpage/completion generation hook, and
produces the archives and packages in `dist/` for inspection. The same path
runs in CI via the release workflow's `workflow_dispatch` dry-run.

## Test layout

Tests live beside the code they cover — there is no top-level `tests/`
directory, which is the Go convention and keeps a package's seams private
to it.

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `<pkg>/<pkg>_test.go` | The package's main suite |
| `testserver_test.go`, `internal/probe/fake_test.go` | Fake MCP and authorization servers under `httptest`, with knobs for the failure modes each phase must observe |
| `*_fuzz_test.go` | Fuzz targets: `FuzzParseWWWAuthenticate` (`auth`), `FuzzReadSSE` (`transport`), `FuzzValidate` and `FuzzArguments` (`diagnostics`); run for a fixed duration per push by `scripts/fuzz.sh` |
| `cmd/*_test.go` | Flag validation, credential resolution and config precedence |

Three properties the suite deliberately enforces:

- **No live servers.** No test contacts a real MCP server or authorization
  server. Every phase is exercised against `httptest` fakes that speak the
  real protocol — a 401 with a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge, protected
  resource metadata at the well-known path, dynamic registration, a token
  endpoint, sessions that 404 when unknown.
- **Secrets are asserted absent.** `TestFullRunClientCredentials` serialises
  every recorded telemetry event and fails if an operator-supplied secret,
  a dynamically registered client secret or an issued token appears in it.
- **The destructive tool is a tripwire.** The fake server panics if its
  unannotated `delete_all` tool is ever invoked under the default policy.

## Trying it against a real server

`scripts/demo-corral.sh` builds scout, starts
[corralctl](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/corralctl)'s MCP server
in HTTP mode on a loopback port, runs a full `scout check` with real
arguments for its lookup tools, and stops the server on exit. It needs
`corralctl` on `PATH`. Any other Streamable HTTP server works the same way:

```sh
make build
./build/scout check http://127.0.0.1:7777/mcp --rps 0 --report-dir ./out
```

## Generated artefacts

Manpages and shell completions are **generated, never committed**:

```sh
make docs        # -> build/man/*.1, build/completions/*
```

They are rendered from the live cobra command tree, which is what keeps them
in step with `--help`. A committed `.1` drifts the first time a flag changes
and nothing catches it.

`build/` is git-ignored. It is deliberately **not** `dist/`: goreleaser owns
that directory and cleans it after running its before-hooks, which would
delete the generated pages before packaging.

## Release model

Releases are tag-triggered and fully automated. Nothing is published by
hand.

1. Prepare the release on a `feat/vX.Y.Z` branch: `CHANGELOG.md` gains a
   `## [X.Y.Z]` heading, and pre-1.0 the patch digit moves. Merge to
   `main`.
2. Dry-run the pipeline: run the Release workflow via `workflow_dispatch`
   with `dry_run: true`. It builds and packages everything and stops before
   publishing, signing and attesting.
3. Tag and push: `git tag -s vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
4. The workflow builds the target matrix, signs with keyless cosign,
   attaches SLSA provenance and a CycloneDX SBOM, and publishes archives,
   deb and rpm packages, the Homebrew formula, the AUR package and the
   container image.

Every commit must be **cryptographically signed** and carry a DCO
`Signed-off-by` trailer. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Conventions

**Coverage threshold: 85% of statements, enforced per package.**

A threshold chosen once and defended beats chasing a number, so here is the
defence. scout's code is network-facing: nine phases, each a sequence of
requests to a server that may answer with any status, any body, or nothing
at all, and each of those outcomes has a defensive branch that turns it
into a finding rather than a panic. Many of those branches — a 3xx on the
token endpoint, an SSE stream that ends mid-event, a certificate that
expires during the run — can only be reached by teaching the fake server
one more failure mode, and the cost of that scaffolding rises faster than
the value of the branch it reaches. 100% is not the goal. What the suite
must do instead is exercise every phase against a real fake server that
speaks the real protocol, so that the findings a user reads were produced
by the same code path a live server would take. The number is a floor that
keeps a new phase from landing untested; the fake servers are what make the
tests mean something.

**Documentation on every exported declaration.** The library packages
(`scout`, `auth`, `transport`, `diagnostics`, `trace`) are the public face
of the module on pkg.go.dev, and an undocumented export renders as an empty
paragraph. `make lint` runs `revive`'s exported-comment check.

**Licence headers on every file.** Enforced by `make spdx-check`. Run
`go run scripts/spdx_sweep.go` to add missing ones.

**Diagnostics go to stderr; stdout carries the selected output format.**
This is what keeps `--output json` and `--output ndjson` pipeable. A
`fmt.Println` on a diagnostic path is a bug; use `internal/diag`.

**A finding passes only on evidence.** Each check records the range of
recorder sequence numbers it made (`req#12-14`), and `pass` is reserved for
a property a request actually showed. See
[docs/adr/0002-findings-cite-requests.md](docs/adr/0002-findings-cite-requests.md).
