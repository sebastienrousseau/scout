// child from scout's console so a Ctrl-C at an interactive run does not go
// to both — but it gives no way to signal the tree and no way to ask
// whether anything is left in it. The mechanism that does is a Job Object,
// and reaching it means golang.org/x/sys/windows, which is an indirect
// dependency today and would become a direct one for a single platform's
// single check.
//
// So this platform sets what it can, kills the process it knows about, and
// reports the rest as unsupported. The check that reads this records a
// skip naming the reason, which is the honest outcome: scout does not claim
// on Windows that nothing was left behind, because it cannot see.

// processGroupsSupported records that this platform cannot do the above.
