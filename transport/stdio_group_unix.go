// Owning the process is not the same as owning what the process starts.
//
// A server spawned with no special treatment shares scout's process group,
// so killing it kills the one process whose pid scout happens to know. A
// server that forked a worker and exited leaves that worker running,
// attached to scout's own group, invisible to Process.Kill and still
// holding whatever the worker held — a port, a lock, a credential in its
// environment. The host that runs this server for real has the same
// problem and no way to see it.
//
// Putting the child in its own process group fixes both halves at once. It
// gives scout a handle on the whole tree rather than on one pid, and it
// makes "did anything outlive the server" a question with an answer:
// signal 0 to the group says whether anybody is still in it.
//
// It also detaches the child from scout's terminal, which is the behaviour
// we want anyway. Ctrl-C at an interactive run now reaches scout alone, and
// scout shuts the server down the documented way — by closing stdin —
// instead of the terminal delivering SIGINT to both and racing.
