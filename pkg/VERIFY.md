# Verifying a release artefact

Every release carries three independent things a packager can check. Do
all three: a checksum alone proves only that the file matches a list
that came from the same place the file did.

Set the version once:

```bash
VERSION=0.0.3
```

## 1. Checksums

```bash
curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/scout/releases/download/v${VERSION}/checksums.txt"
sha256sum --check --ignore-missing checksums.txt
```

## 2. Signature (keyless cosign)

The checksum file is signed with a short-lived certificate bound to the
release workflow's identity, and the signature is logged in Rekor. There
is no long-lived key to steal, so the *identity* is the thing to check:
`--certificate-identity-regexp` below pins the signature to this
repository's release workflow, not merely to "some GitHub Actions run".

The signature ships as a **sigstore bundle** (`checksums.txt.sigstore.json`),
which carries the certificate and the signature together.

```bash
curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/scout/releases/download/v${VERSION}/checksums.txt.sigstore.json"

cosign verify-blob \
  --bundle checksums.txt.sigstore.json \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/sebastienrousseau/scout/\.github/workflows/release\.yml@refs/tags/v' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com' \
  checksums.txt
```

Success prints `Verified OK`. Anything else means do not use the
artefact.

## 3. Provenance (SLSA)

```bash
gh attestation verify "scout_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz" \
  --repo sebastienrousseau/scout
```

This states which workflow, at which commit, built the artefact, which is
the claim a checksum cannot make.

## 4. SBOM

A CycloneDX SBOM (`*.cdx.sbom.json`) is attached to each archive on the
release. If your distribution records dependencies, take them from there
rather than transcribing them.

## If verification fails

Do not package the artefact, and please open a security advisory rather
than an issue: <https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/scout/security/advisories/new>.
