Thanks for contributing to scout.

Before opening: branch from `main` and target `main`. A pull request based on
another branch runs no CI here (every workflow filters on
`branches: [main]`) and GitHub records it as merged with an empty commit range
once the branch it was stacked on lands.
-->

## What this changes

<!-- One or two sentences. What is different after this merges? -->

## Why

<!-- The problem, not the patch. If it fixes an issue, link it: Fixes #123 -->

## How it was verified

<!--
Not "it builds". What did you run, and what did you observe? Delete the lines
that do not apply and say what you actually did for the rest.
-->

- [ ] `make test` passes
- [ ] `make test-race` passes
- [ ] New or changed behaviour is covered by a test against a fake server that fails without the change
- [ ] A new finding cites its requests (`req#N`) and cannot pass without one
- [ ] `make sbom` passes (required if `go.mod` changed)
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has an entry under the right heading

## Risk

<!--
What could this break, and what would that look like? "Nothing" is a valid
answer for a docs change; it is rarely the right answer for anything touching
the redactor, the safety policy, or the auth transport chain.
