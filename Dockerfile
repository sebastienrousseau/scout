# Runtime image for scout.
#
# The binary is expected to already be built by goreleaser. Do NOT compile
# from source here: the image must ship the same artefact the tarball does,
# or `docker pull` and a downloaded release are not the same program.
#
# dockers_v2 lays the build context out by platform — linux/amd64/scout,
# linux/arm64/scout — and buildx sets TARGETPLATFORM per architecture as it
# builds the manifest. The old dockers: section dropped one binary at the
# context root, which is why this used to copy plain `scout`.
#
# The base is distroless/static: scout is a static binary with CGO off, and
# needs nothing from the image but CA certificates and a non-root user,
# both of which distroless ships. It is pinned by digest, which OpenSSF
# Scorecard checks and which release-config in ci.yml refuses to release
# without. The digest below is the real one — v0.0.1 and v0.1.0 both
# shipped from it — and Dependabot keeps it fresh. To resolve it by hand:
#   docker buildx imagetools inspect gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot
