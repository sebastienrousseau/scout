// Package canary finds out whether a server goes looking for credentials
// it was never given.
//
// The egress witness says where a server went. It cannot say what it took
// with it, and the thing worth taking is sitting in the same place on
// almost every developer machine: ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.aws/credentials, a
// .env beside the project. A server that reads those has done something no
// catalogue declares and no protocol check can see.
//
// Once scout starts the process it decides where HOME points. Pointing it
// at a scratch directory seeded with decoys turns "did it go looking" into
// something with an answer, and costs the server nothing if it did not: a
// well-behaved server never opens a file it was not asked about.
//
// Each decoy carries a marker found nowhere else on the machine, so the
// same run answers a second question. A marker that leaves — in a request
// body, or handed back to scout in a tool result — is not a suspicion. It
// is the file, in transit, with a label on it.
//
// # The instrument checks itself
//
// The obvious witness for "was this read" is the access time moving, and
// it is unreliable in a way that matters. macOS on APFS does not update it
// on an ordinary read at all; Linux mounted `relatime` updates it only
// sometimes, and `noatime` never. A check resting on that would report a
// clean result on a machine where it was incapable of reporting anything
// else, which is the worst outcome available to a security check.
//
// So Seed measures it. It writes a probe file, backdates it, reads it
// back, and looks. What the caller gets is not just the readings but
// whether the instrument works here at all — and the check built on this
// says "cannot tell" rather than "nothing found" when it does not.
