// Package policy is a reviewable statement of what a team will accept from an
// MCP server.
//
// scout could already gate a run: a failing finding exits 2, and `scout
// verify` takes --require, --max-fail and --min-score. That is enough for one
// pipeline and not enough for an organisation, for three reasons a flag
// cannot fix.
//
// A flag is not reviewable. "Why does this server pass?" is answered by
// reading a CI YAML file, and a change to what the company accepts arrives as
// a diff to a shell line nobody reviews. A policy is a file with a name and a
// version that goes through the same review as code.
//
// A flag cannot carry an exception. Real gates are adopted only if a team can
// say "this one check, on this server, for this reason, until this date" —
// otherwise the gate is turned off wholesale on its first inconvenient
// morning. So an exemption is a first-class object here, and it is invalid
// without a reason and an expiry: an exemption with no expiry is a permanent
// hole nobody ever revisits, which is the state most security exceptions end
// up in.
//
// A flag cannot be refused. A policy file written for a later version of
// scout, or carrying a rule this build does not implement, is rejected rather
// than partly applied — because a policy engine that ignores what it does not
// understand is a policy engine that approves things. That is the one property
// worth being inflexible about.
