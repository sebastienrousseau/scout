// Package supply reads what a server is made of, out of the server.
//
// scout scores how a server behaves on the wire and, until now, said
// nothing about the artifact behind it. For the platform-team half of the
// audience that is the first question they are asked — what is in this
// thing, and can you prove where it came from — and the one scout could
// not answer.
//
// For a Go server it can, with no new dependency and no network. A Go
// binary carries its own module graph: every dependency with its version
// and its h1: checksum, the toolchain that built it, the target platform,
// and — when it was built from a checkout — the commit and whether the
// tree was dirty at the time. debug/buildinfo reads all of it out of the
// file.
//
// This only applies to a stdio target, for the same reason the egress
// witness does: an endpoint is a URL, and a URL is not a file scout can
// open. What the operator ran is a path, and a path can be read.
//
// A dirty build is the finding worth having here. A binary whose
// vcs.modified is true cannot be traced back to any commit: the source it
// was built from does not exist in the repository, so no review of that
// repository describes what is running. It is the one provenance fact that
// is both cheap to establish and impossible to argue with.
