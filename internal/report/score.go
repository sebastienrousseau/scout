// RubricVersion is the version of the scoring rubric.
//
// It exists because a score is only comparable to another score computed the
// same way. "82/100" in a report from 2027 and "82/100" from 2029 are the
// same number about possibly different things, and an attestation that
// carries the total without the rubric behind it is publishing a figure
// nothing can be compared to.
//
// Increment it when the weights change, when a category is added or removed,
// or when the deduction model changes — anything that would move a score
// without the server moving. Never increment it for a new check inside an
// existing category: that is the rubric working, not changing.
//
// 1: six weighted categories — connectivity 10, authorization 20, protocol
// 20, catalog 15, execution 20, performance 15 — scored over the phases each
// names, with unassessed categories excluded from the weighting rather than
// counted as zero.

// CheckInventoryVersion is the version of the check catalogue the ids in a
// report belong to.
//
// It follows the same rule as SchemaVersion, for the same reason: increment it
// when an id is renamed, removed, or changes what it asserts, and never when
// one is added. A consumer holding an attestation from two years ago needs to
// know whether `catalog.tools.output_schema` still means what it meant then,
// and the generated inventory cannot tell it that on its own — docs/checks.md
// describes the current catalogue, not the one the statement was written
// against.

// <phase>.<check> form with auth.source.* as the one computed family.
