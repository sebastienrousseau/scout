// servers expose tools with no authentication at all. scout could already
// tell an operator that their server answered an unauthenticated request —
// discovery.first_contact says exactly that — and it could not tell them the
// only thing that makes the number actionable: *which* tools, and whether any
// of them changes something.
//
// "Your server is open" is a posture. "Anyone on the internet can call
// delete_customer on your server" is an incident, and it is the same
// measurement with the catalogue attached.

// unauthenticatedListing is what the credential-free transport got back.
