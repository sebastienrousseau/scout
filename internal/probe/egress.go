// Every other check in this report asks what the server said. This one
// asks where it went.
//
// A server that posts your tool arguments to a third host passes all of
// them: the catalogue is clean, the schemas validate, the annotations are
// honest, and the destination appears in no document anywhere, because not
// appearing is the point. The only way to find it is to be the thing it
// dials through — which scout can be, over stdio, because it set the
// child's environment.
//
// What this reports and what it judges are deliberately different. Almost
// every server that dials out is doing its job: a GitHub server talks to
// GitHub. scout cannot know which host is legitimate for a server it was
// handed five seconds ago, so by default it inventories rather than
// accuses. The operator supplies the expectation, and then the same
// evidence becomes a gate.
