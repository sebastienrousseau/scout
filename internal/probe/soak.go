// A soak asks the one question fifty requests cannot: does the server's
// memory settle, or does every call leave something behind? A host keeps
// one process for a whole session, and a server that grows by a few
// kilobytes a call is fine in a demo and dead by the afternoon.
//
// The measurement is the slope, not the peak. Every runtime grows its heap
// while it warms up and most hold a sawtooth afterwards, so the first
// samples are dropped and a line is fitted through the rest; a line that
// explains the variation and adds up to something is the finding. It is
// read from /proc after every call, which is why this is Linux-only and
// stdio-only: scout has to own the process to know its memory.
//
// Nothing here runs unless the operator asked with --soak, and the calls
// it makes go through the same throttle as the rest of the run.

// slope is noise with a sign.
