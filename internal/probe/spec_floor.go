// Two properties of the 2026-07-28 revision that scout modelled and never
// reported. Both are about the edges of the protocol rather than its centre,
// and both are things an operator cannot see from anywhere else.
//
// The first is what the server has added: server/discover carries a list of
// extensions, and every entry on it is surface an agent may exercise. A
// report that lists a server's tools and says nothing about the extensions
// beside them is describing half the interface.
//
// The second is what the server has not removed. The revision deleted
// initialize, ping and the session; a server that still answers the first
// two is either supporting older clients deliberately — which is allowed,
// and which supportedVersions is how it says so — or carrying handlers that
// no current client will ever call. Those two cases look identical from
// outside and mean opposite things, which is why this check reads
// supportedVersions before deciding which it is looking at.

// extensionID is a reverse-DNS identifier, optionally with a /name suffix:
// io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks, com.example.mcp/billing. The domain part
// must contain a dot, because that is the whole point of reverse-DNS — a
// bare word claims no namespace and collides with the next server that
// picks it.

// specNamespace is the prefix the specification reserves for itself. It is
// how scout separates an extension defined by MCP from one an author
// invented, which is the difference between "this server speaks Tasks" and
// "this server speaks something only its own client knows about".
