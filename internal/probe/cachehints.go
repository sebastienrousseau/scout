// The catalogue budget check says what a catalogue costs to look at. This
// one says whether the server did anything about it.
//
// A catalogue is fetched again by every client, on every session, and then
// paid for in context on every call after that. The 2026-07-28 revision
// answers that directly: any list result may carry `ttlMs`, how long a
// client may keep it, and `cacheScope`, whether that cache may be shared
// between users. A server that states them lets a client stop re-fetching
// a catalogue it already has.
//
// Two things keep this honest. Both fields are optional, so their absence
// is a missed opportunity and not a violation — it is reported as a
// warning only on a catalogue large enough for the re-fetch to cost
// something, and as an observation otherwise. And they do not exist before
// 2026-07-28 at all, so a session-era server is not asked about them: it
// would be a finding about the revision the operator is running, not about
// the server.

// cacheHintFloor is the catalogue size, in the same estimated tokens the
// budget check uses, above which saying nothing about caching is worth a
// warning rather than a note.
//
// Set at the budget's own warn threshold so the two cannot disagree: the
// point at which a catalogue stops being free is the point at which
// re-fetching it starts to matter.
