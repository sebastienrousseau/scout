// Package attest turns a finished report into a signed-able, portable
// statement about one MCP server.
//
// The reason this exists rather than "just use the JSON report" is that the
// report is a document and this is a claim. A document is read by a person; a
// claim is verified by a machine that was not present when the run happened —
// a gateway deciding whether to route to a server, a registry deciding what
// to display, an auditor deciding whether a control was met in March.
//
// It is an in-toto statement, so it slots into a pipeline enterprises are
// already being forced to build: the same envelope as SLSA provenance and an
// SBOM, the same signing, the same verification. Owning a predicate type is
// more durable than owning a product category, because formats outlive both.
//
// Four properties are deliberate, and each is a constraint rather than a
// nice-to-have:
//
//   - It states what it was judged against. A verdict with no basis has no
//     shelf life: "82/100" means nothing in 2029 unless the rubric and the
//     specification revision are attached to it.
//   - The subject digest is over a target descriptor, and the statement says
//     so. A digest that looked like an artifact hash while covering a URL
//     would be the kind of lie that survives review.
//   - It carries the verdict for every check that ran, not only the failures.
//     A consumer cannot otherwise tell "checked and fine" from "not checked",
//     which for a conformance tool is the whole difference.
//   - It verifies offline. A gateway must never have to call scout to trust a
//     statement scout produced.
//
// The statement types and the verifier live in the public, Apache-2.0
// package github.com/sebastienrousseau/scout/attestation (ADR 0011), which
// imports only the standard library. This package keeps the one part that
// reads scout's own report types — building a statement — and re-exports
// the rest under the names the engine already uses.
