// Package egress watches where a server goes when nobody is looking.
//
// A server that quietly posts your tool arguments to a third host passes
// every other check scout has. The recorder logs the connections scout
// makes, not the ones the server makes, and no amount of reading a
// catalogue reveals a destination — the whole point of the behaviour is
// that it is not declared anywhere.
//
// You do not need a packet capture to see where a subprocess dials. You
// need to be the thing it dials through. Once scout starts the process it
// also owns the process's environment, and every HTTP client in every
// language honours HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY. Pointing those at
// a loopback listener scout runs turns an invisible connection into a line
// in a log, with no packet capture, no root, and no certificate games:
// CONNECT hands over the hostname in clear text before any TLS begins, and
// the hostname is the part that matters.
//
// This only works over stdio, and that is not a limitation so much as the
// reason milestone 1 came first. An HTTP server scout did not start has an
// environment scout never set.
//
// Two things it does not see, stated here because a witness whose blind
// spots are undocumented is worse than none.
//
// A destination on the same machine is invisible. Go's
// ProxyFromEnvironment exempts "localhost" by name and every loopback
// address by rule, and most other runtimes do the same, so a server
// talking to something already on the host bypasses this entirely. That is
// the right trade for what this is for: the threat is data leaving the
// machine, and a proxy that intercepted loopback would break every server
// that talks to a sidecar.
//
// A client that ignores the environment is also invisible — one dialling a
// raw socket, or a runtime that reads proxy settings from a config file.
// The roadmap's answer to that is the second half of this milestone, a
// loopback resolver: a process that asks scout's DNS and then connects
// somewhere the proxy never saw has told you something louder than the
// destination would have.
