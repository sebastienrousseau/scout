// that a multi-repository family cannot silently drift. This is that table,
// and it is a typed Go value rather than a configuration file for three
// reasons: the compiler checks it, a test can assert invariants over it, and
// nothing has to parse it.
//
// It is the single source. docs/ecosystem.md's table and the ecosystem.json

// scripts/ecosystem, and CI fails when either has drifted — the same
// arrangement as the generated check inventory, for the same reason.
