// Package watch tells you a server is still the one you reviewed.
//
// A check tells you a server was sound when you ran it. That is a
// statement about a moment, and the threat it cannot see by construction
// is the one that waits: the server that passes review and edits its tool
// descriptions the following week is the server that gets through.
// --baseline closes that gap for anyone who remembers to run it again.
// This is the part that does the remembering.
//
// # A watcher has to be polite
//
// scout tells every operator to throttle, and a watcher that re-ran nine
// phases on a loop would be the abusive client it warns about. So a pulse
// is deliberately small: connect, list the catalogue, hash it, compare.
// Two requests and a string comparison, which is what the content address
// in a baseline snapshot was for. A full diagnostic is what happens when
// the hash moves, not what happens every few minutes.
//
// Between pulses there is a timer and nothing else — no polling loop, no
// spin. A process that is going to run for months earns that.
